## Example Analysis

* [Salary Gender](https://juliasilge.com/blog/salary-gender/)
  * linear models
  * linear mixed effects models
  * bayesian multi-level models
* [Building Energy Use](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-machine-learning-walk-through-in-python-part-one-c62152f39420)

## Project Ideas

* Distribution over W-L records and playoff seeding in divisions like NBA/NFL
  * For example in NBA right now 8th seeds have losing records, how expected would this outcome be?
  * Top heavy vs parity, different resulting distributions based on these initial conditions
  * [Predicting Playoff Position Probability](https://fansided.com/2019/02/07/nylon-calculus-predicting-playoff-position-probability/)
    * Bayesian Inference
    * Binomial Likelihood

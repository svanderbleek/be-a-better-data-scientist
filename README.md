## Project Ideas

### Distribution over W-L records and playoff seeding in divisions like NBA/NFL

For example in NBA right now 8th seeds have losing records, how expected would this outcome be?

  * Bayesian Inference
  * Binomial Likelihood

#### Parity

Top heavy vs parity, different resulting distributions based on these initial conditions

* [NFL Scores Data](https://www.kaggle.com/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data)
  * Could use NFL/NBA scores to sample from to simulate win/loss distributions based on observed score distributions

### Papers

> If you want to read the derivations of the properties of the various tests, they're usually available. I've read Pearson's paper on the multinomial chi-square goodness of fit test, Student's paper on the t-test, later papers by Fisher on both tests (as well as papers by other authors on them); I've read Wilcoxon's paper where he does both the rank sum and signed rank tests; Mann and Whitney's paper that develops U-statistics and extends Wilcoxon's rank sum test; Kruskal and Wallis' paper on their test; Freidman's paper on his, and so on through hundreds more papers.

## Project Ideas

### Distribution over W-L records and playoff seeding in divisions like NBA/NFL

For example in NBA right now 8th seeds have losing records, how expected would this outcome be?

* [The dreadful race for 8th in the NBA's Western Conference is incredibly unfamiliar](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28450353/the-dreadful-race-8th-nba-western-conference-incredibly-unfamiliar)

  * Bayesian Inference
  * Binomial Likelihood

#### Parity

Top heavy vs parity, different resulting distributions based on these initial conditions
